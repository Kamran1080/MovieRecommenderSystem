# **Movie Recommendation System**

A Python-based movie recommendation system that suggests movies similar to the user's choice. The system provides a list of recommended movies along with their posters, creating an interactive and visually appealing experience.

## **Features**
- Recommends 5 movies similar to the selected movie.
- Displays movie posters fetched dynamically using the TMDb API.
- User-friendly interface built with Streamlit.
- Leverages machine learning for similarity-based recommendations.

## **How It Works**
1. **Input Selection**: The user selects a movie from a dropdown menu.
2. **Recommendation Logic**:
   - A pre-computed similarity matrix identifies the top 5 most similar movies.
3. **Poster Retrieval**: The TMDb API fetches posters for the recommended movies.
4. **Output**: The recommended movie titles and posters are displayed in a grid layout.
